# Car-insurance-cross-sell-prediction
Predicting customer insurance purchases based on factors such as car damage status and existing insurance coverage was achieved using foundational Python libraries. I leveraged tools like Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn (sklearn) to preprocess the data and utilized logistic regression for prediction. This project enhanced my ability to apply machine learning techniques to real-world datasets effectively.
